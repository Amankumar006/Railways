- Use the Indian Railways logo prominently in the center
- Include the text "Coach Inspection" below the logo
- Add "भारतीय रेल" (Hindi for Indian Railways) below the English text
- Use white color for all text and logo elements to contrast with the blue background

## Technical Specifications
- Image dimensions: 1242 x 2436 pixels (optimized for various device sizes)
- Format: PNG with transparency

## Design Inspiration

This splash screen will be the first thing users see when opening the application, so it should convey the official and professional nature of the Indian Railways organization.
