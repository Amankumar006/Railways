# Signup Flow Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Loading Screen Stuck**: The signup process was getting stuck on the loading screen because the auth state change listener was automatically logging users in even when they should be pending approval.

2. **Bypassing Admin Approval**: Users were being logged in without admin approval because the `mapUserData` function was defaulting to `approvalStatus: 'approved'` when no profile was found.

3. **Navigation Issues**: The signup screen was trying to navigate before the auth state was properly set, causing race conditions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Default Approval Status

**File**: `context/AuthContext.tsx`

- Changed default `approvalStatus` from `'approved'` to `'pending'` in the `mapUserData` function
- This ensures new users require approval by default

```typescript
// Before
approvalStatus: 'approved', // Set to approved to allow login

// After  
approvalStatus: 'pending', // Set to pending by default - users need approval
```

### 2. Enhanced Auth State Change Listener

**File**: `context/AuthContext.tsx`

- Added proper logging to track auth state changes
- Improved handling of pending and rejected users
- Ensured users are signed out immediately if not approved

```typescript
// Added comprehensive logging and proper state management
console.log('Auth state change:', event, session ? 'session exists' : 'no session');
console.log('User mapped:', user.email, user.approvalStatus);
```

### 3. Improved Signup Function

**File**: `context/AuthContext.tsx`

- Enhanced error handling and cleanup
- Proper state management for pending approval
- Added explicit `approvalStatus: 'pending'` to the final state

```typescript
user: {
  ...profileData,
  id: data.user.id,
  approvalStatus: 'pending' as const,
},
```

### 4. Fixed Signup Screen Navigation

**File**: `app/(auth)/signup.tsx`

- Added `pendingApproval` state monitoring
- Implemented `useEffect` to handle automatic navigation when approval status changes
- Simplified navigation logic to avoid race conditions
- Replaced platform-specific alerts with our unified error handler

```typescript
// Handle pendingApproval state change
useEffect(() => {
  if (pendingApproval && !loading && !isSubmitting) {
    logDebug('Pending approval detected, navigating to pending approval page');
    router.replace('/(auth)/pending-approval');
  }
}, [pendingApproval, loading, isSubmitting, router]);
```

### 5. Replaced Console Statements

**File**: `app/(auth)/signup.tsx`

- Replaced all `console.log` and `console.error` with our production-safe logger
- Replaced `Alert.alert` with our cross-platform error handler

## How It Works Now

1. **User Signs Up**: User fills out the form and clicks "Sign Up"
2. **Account Creation**: 
   - Auth user is created in Supabase
   - Profile is created with `approval_status: 'pending'`
   - User is immediately signed out
3. **State Management**: 
   - Auth context sets `pendingApproval: true`
   - Loading state is cleared
4. **Navigation**: 
   - `useEffect` detects `pendingApproval` state
   - Automatically navigates to pending approval screen
5. **Approval Process**: 
   - User sees pending approval message
   - Admin must approve the account before user can log in

## Benefits

- ✅ No more stuck loading screens
- ✅ Proper admin approval enforcement
- ✅ Clean navigation flow
- ✅ Cross-platform error handling
- ✅ Production-safe logging
- ✅ Better user experience

## Testing

To test the signup flow:

1. Go to signup page
2. Fill out the form with valid data
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Should see loading briefly, then navigate to pending approval page
5. Try to log in with the same credentials - should be denied until admin approval

The signup process now properly enforces the admin approval workflow and provides a smooth user experience.
